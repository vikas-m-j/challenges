## Challenge 1
Designed 3-tier architecture in AWS. Screenshots are attached in the document *3-tier-architecture-in-AWS* and present in **Challenge1** folder.

## Challenge 2
Python program is written to query metadata of an ec2 instance within AWS and provide a json formatted output and also retrieve the value of a particular data key.

## Challenge 3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the value.
Implemented this in C++.

Assumptions:
We have an input that is consistent with below format:
* The object always starts with '{'
* key always follows '{' and ends before ':'
* value or nested object follows after ':'
